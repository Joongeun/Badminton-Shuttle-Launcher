Tinkercad circuit + simulation: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/enLgOJtReA6-shuttle-launcher-with-stepper-motor?sharecode=hrb_zLyMkX1Xn8ryhTYP3mwj19c6sHutu6KG5KmvFZI 
(Note: the speed control for the stepper motor will not work because the stepper motor driver board is unavailable on Tinkercad, so in the simulation, the stepper constantly receives 5V regardless of potentiometer inputs).
